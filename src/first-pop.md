# Pop

`push`同様，`pop`もリストに変更を加えますが，`push`と違い返り値があります．
そしてリストが空の場合という厄介な状態を考えなくてはいけません．この
ケースに対処するために，信頼できる`Option`型を使います：

```rust ,ignore
pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
    // TODO
}
```

`Option<T>`は値が存在するかもしれないことを表すのに使われ，`Some(T)`か`None`
の状態を取ることができます．Linkのときみたいに似たような型を自作することも
できますが，このリストを使う人が戻り値の型が一体全体何なのか考えなくていいように
Optionという知らない人がいないほどありふれてる型を使います．実際あまりにも
基礎的なので何も書かなくても`Some`と`None`と一緒にすべての.rsファイルに
インポートされています（なので`Option::None`とか書かなくてもいいのです）．

`Option<T>`のとげとげはOptionがTの*ジェネリック型*であることを表しています．
どんな型のOptionも作ることができるのです！

はい，で，この`Link`とかいうのがあるわけですが，どうやってこれがEmptyかMoreか
判断するのでしょう？`match`を使ったパターンマッチングです！

```rust ,ignore
pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
    match self.head {
        Link::Empty => {
            // TODO
        }
        Link::More(node) => {
            // TODO
        }
    };
}
```

```

Whoops, `pop` has to return a value, and we're not doing that yet. We *could*
return `None`, but in this case it's probably a better idea to return
`unimplemented!()`, to indicate that we aren't done implementing the function.
`unimplemented!()` is a macro (`!` indicates a macro) that panics the program
when we get to it (\~crashes it in a controlled manner).

```rust ,ignore
pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
    match self.head {
        Link::Empty => {
            // TODO
        }
        Link::More(node) => {
            // TODO
        }
    };
    unimplemented!()
}
```

Unconditional panics are an example of a [diverging function][diverging].
Diverging functions never return to the caller, so they may be used in places
where a value of any type is expected. Here, `unimplemented!()` is being
used in place of a value of type `Option<T>`.

Note also that we don't need to write `return` in our program. The last
expression (basically line) in a function is implicitly its return value. This
lets us express really simple things a bit more concisely. You can always
explicitly return early with `return` like any other C-like language.

Come on Rust, get off our back! As always, Rust is hella mad at us. Thankfully,
this time it's also giving us the full scoop! By default, a pattern match will
try to move its contents into the new branch, but we can't do this because we
don't own self by-value here.

```text
help: consider borrowing here: `&self.head`
```

Rust says we should add a reference to our `match` to fix that. 🤷‍♀️ Let's try it:

```rust ,ignore
pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
    match &self.head {
        Link::Empty => {
            // TODO
        }
        Link::More(ref node) => {
            // TODO
        }
    };
    unimplemented!()
}
```

Hooray, compiling again! Now let's figure out that logic. We want to make an
Option, so let's make a variable for that. In the Empty case we need to return
None. In the More case we need to return `Some(i32)`, and change the head of
the list. So, let's try to do basically that?

```rust ,ignore
pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
    let result;
    match &self.head {
        Link::Empty => {
            result = None;
        }
        Link::More(ref node) => {
            result = Some(node.elem);
            self.head = node.next;
        }
    };
    result
}
```

*head*

*desk*

We're trying to move out of `node` when all we have is a shared reference to it.

We should probably step back and think about what we're trying to do. We want
to:

* Check if the list is empty.
* If it's empty, just return None
* If it's *not* empty
    * remove the head of the list
    * remove its `elem`
    * replace the list's head with its `next`
    * return `Some(elem)`

The key insight is we want to *remove* things, which means we want to get the
head of the list *by value*. We certainly can't do that through the shared
reference we get through `&self.head`. We also "only" have a mutable reference
to `self`, so the only way we can move stuff is to *replace it*. Looks like we're doing
the Empty dance again!

Let's try that:


```rust ,ignore
pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
    let result;
    match mem::replace(&mut self.head, Link::Empty) {
        Link::Empty => {
            result = None;
        }
        Link::More(node) => {
            result = Some(node.elem);
            self.head = node.next;
        }
    };
    result
}
```

O M G

It compiled without *any* warnings!!!!!

Actually I'm going to apply my own personal lint here: we made this `result`
value to return, but actually we didn't need to do that at all! Just as a
function evaluates to its last expression, every block also evaluates to
its last expression. Normally we supress this behaviour with semi-colons,
which instead makes the block evaluate to the empty tuple, `()`. This is
actually the value that functions which don't declare a return value -- like
`push` -- return.

So instead, we can write `pop` as:

```rust ,ignore
pub fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
    match mem::replace(&mut self.head, Link::Empty) {
        Link::Empty => None,
        Link::More(node) => {
            self.head = node.next;
            Some(node.elem)
        }
    }
}
```

Which is a bit more concise and idiomatic. Note that the Link::Empty branch
completely lost its braces, because we only have one expression to
evaluate. Just a nice shorthand for simple cases.

Nice, still works!
